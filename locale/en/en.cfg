[mod-setting-description]
terrain-scale=A simple multiplier for the raw scale of the overall pattern; larger values means the web of rivers is "scaled up" in size, with larger continents inside them.
terrain-mixin-seed=This affects the seed used for the terrain program (and how it is combined with the map seed). Use this to get a new distribution with an existing map.
river-thickness=A simple multiplier for how thick the dividing rivers should be. Only applies for some map generation algorithms.
