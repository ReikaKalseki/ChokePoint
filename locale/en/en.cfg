[mod-setting-description]
terrain-scale=A simple multiplier for the raw scale of the overall pattern; larger values means the web of rivers is "scaled up" in size, with larger continents inside them.
terrain-mixin-seed=This affects the seed used for the terrain program (and how it is combined with the map seed). Use this to get a new distribution with an existing map.
river-thickness=A simple multiplier for how thick the dividing rivers should be. Only applies for some map generation algorithms.
allow-traversible-shores=Whether to allow the generator to make the innermost shores "mud water", which is traversible to you (slowly) and to biters (normal speed). This looks better, and makes transport a bit easier, but means that walls cannot be 100% effective.
distance-falloff=How much the effect of the river generation should fade with distance. At 100%, the rivers will be half-width at 50 tiles and not generate at all past 100 tiles. This makes the worldgen gradually faster to compute the further you go, without affecting chokepoints near spawn, which are the ones that really matter from a gameplay perspective.
